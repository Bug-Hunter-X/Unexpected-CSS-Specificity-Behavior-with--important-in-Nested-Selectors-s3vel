The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the intended specificity of selectors doesn't work as expected due to an uncommon error involving the use of the `!important` flag within nested selectors:

```css
.container {
  color: blue;
}

.container .inner {
  color: red !important; 
}

.container .inner .nested {
  color: green;
}
```

In this case, one might expect the `.container .inner .nested` element to inherit the `color: red` from its parent with `!important` and then be overridden by the `color: green` declaration. However, the `!important` declaration only applies to the direct selector `.container .inner`, thus the nested element inherits the `color: blue` from the `.container` selector, rather than the red.   The `!important` flag does not cascade down through nested elements.
